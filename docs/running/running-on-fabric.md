# Running on Fabric

You can run Zingg on Microsoft Fabric directly using the Fabric notebook interface.

This uses the Zingg Python API and an [example notebook](../../examples/fabric/ExampleNotebook.ipynb) and a [step by step guide](https://www.zingg.ai/documentation-article/step-by-step-identity-resolution-with-zingg-on-fabric) is available.
